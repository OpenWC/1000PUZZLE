In this argument, the editor concludes that if the town conuncil of Balmer Island can limit the number of mopeds rented by the island's rental companies from 50 per day to 25 per day during the summer season, the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians can be reduced. to bolster this conclusion, the editor points out that neighboring island Seaville last year by limiting the number of rentals, the accidents of Seaville reduce 50 percent. However this do not compose a logical argument, in favor of it's conclusion, and fail to provide convincing support making this argument reasonable and invunlnerable.

First, the editor recommendation relies on what might be a poor analogy between island Seaville and island Balmer. The analogy falsely depends on the assumption that island Seaville and island Balmer is similar. However, it is entirely possible that there are huge difference between two island, for example, maybe the 
road quality is different, the Seaville's road is really not suitable for mopeds, so limiting the number of mopeds will make a reduction of accidents, but the road of Balmer is fit for the mopeds, so even if we limit the number of mopeds, there will be more cars, but cars may not fit for the Balmer island's road, 
actrually, it would be more accidents. In short, without accounting for this possible different between island Balmer and island Seaville, the editor can not prove that Balmer will reap the similar benefits from the proposed methods.(比较错误)


Secondly, even if the first conclusion is right, the editor fails to establish the causal realtionship between limiting the number of rentals in Seaville and the accidents attain the 50 percent annual redution. the editor try to conclude that because of the limitation, the accidents have reduced, However, it perhaps toally not because that reason, maybe the accidents redution is because the a course of traffic accidents edutation made by Seaville are really impressive and all of the citizen living in Seaville island must learn this course. or maybe because the road in Seaville island have been reconstruction for a while, so the quality of the road is much better than ever, so the accidents reduced, Lacking evidence that links traffic accidents reduction to limiting the number of mopeds, it is presumptuous to suggest that accidents reduction was responsible for limit the number of mopeds.(因果关系)


Thirdly, even if the two island are same and the accidents reduce of Seaville island is because of limit mopeds number, 50 percent annumal reduction maybe not a big number,  because the mopeds number could be small, for example, maybe the whole Seaville island mopeds number is 20, so the 50 percent reduction which is 10 mpopeds reduction is not a impressive number. and maybe the Balmer have thounds of mopeds, so the reduction of Seaville does not have reference value. In short, without better evidence that the data is statistically reliable, the editor cannot rely on it to draw any firm conclusions.(调查错误，数据问题)

To sum up, the editor fails to substantiate his calim that if the town conuncil of Balmer Island can limit the number of mopeds rented by the island's rental companies from 50 per day to 25 per day during the summer season, the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians can be reduced, because the evidence cited does not lend strong support to what editor maintains. To make the argument more convincing, the editor would have to provide more information with regard to the data of accidents reduce number of mopeds in Seaville island and the quality diffent between two island etc...
