The best way to solve environmental problems caused by consumer-generated waste is for
towns and cities to impose strict limits on the amount of trash they will accept from each
household.



The speaker claim that the best way to solve environmental problems of consumer-generated waste is limiting the amount of trash of each household. I disagree the conclusion of speaker, limiting the amount of waste is the last step you can take, espically in some deveploed country like America, England, Janpan etc... However, something, if you do not have any other plans, like country in Africa, you have to take the last step -- limit the amount of waste -- instead of things getting worse.
