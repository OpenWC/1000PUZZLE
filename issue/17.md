The speaker claim that ...... I agree with the speaker's claim that..... for example....... However ........

Thomas Edison is a famous inventor and businessman of America, his was know by invent lots of useful things including light bulb, a revolution tools at that time. which many people like it. When Edison was at his yong ege, he was teached by normoal school, but the teacher which used formal education method,  who thought his is not clever and even stipid, but Edison's mother did not think so, so she just let the Edison drop out the school, and teach her son by herself, her education is very
unique, and let Edison reading a lots of book even does not seem have some realtionship with formal education, due to this informal education, the Thomas Edison became a great man in the world, an true inventor. So I believe formal education sometimes always not good for everyone, because everyone is unique, so you have to treat every one specially.

Another example that formal education method that does not work well is students of china mainland, in china there is an final entrance exam of college, before people participate this exam, thousands of student were treat as same people, learning same textbook, wrting same homework, even the teacher told them, they should think same, because in entrance exam, if you don't think same, you are incorrect, you will failed.
so the result is the more people have high score, the more they have less creativity.
this is really a sarcastic.

But sometimes, informal education could be not all good, especially when you treat this 
informal education not serious as formal education, when some children heard informal education, they should think the informal education is play, not study, that's the situation
we should avoid, so how to make informal education more serious, best way is look for some method already used in formal education, and balanced both of them.

In sum, the speaker's claim iiiisss,  However if add .... it would be better ......
