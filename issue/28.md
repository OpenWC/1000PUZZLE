The speaker claim that the surest indicator of great nation is represented by the general welfare of its people instead of by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists. I do not disagree the only focus general welfare of its people could make a nation a great nation, generally, a powerful country usullay have more great scientists, artists and rulers, also a great rulers usually make better policy to let people live more wealthy. However, at the sametime, when a nation already have a lots of greate people, we should also concern about the general welfare and poor people.

For greate artist and scientists, United States is the best example, US's migration policy welcome scientists, engineers, artisits all over the world to contribute to this country, that's why US is the greatest country in this world. And also for rulers, because of greatest rulers like Geroge Waston, the fathor of United States, who made a lots of greate policy, separation of powers which made the Supreme Court, President and Congress restrict each other. that is how today people live in this great country with great laws.

Another example is Sweden, in this country, there also lots of great scientists, the world's famous science prize nobel prize, granted to people who made greate success in science,literature and society, is hold in here every year, also there is lots great sweden scientists in the histroy. in a world, when a country have more and more scientists artists, rulers, they will made more contributation to this country and new telchnolgy will made this far more rich, because they the new telchnolgy make the efficiency more faster than ever.

But we should aware of some of sutiations in America, for past 10 years, America still is the best telchnolgy country, and made a lots of telchnolgy improvement, but the generally welfare of people is down compare to ten years ago, this is because of the current government much more concern about rich people and big international company and miss the generally welfare, so the rich people is getting more and more rich and poor people and the middle class still remain the same as ten years ago.

In sum, we should more concern about the greate scientists, artists, rulers, because these people is the origin make a country more and more powerful and productive, also when the country is rich, we should also consider the general people: middle class, poor people, make sure they all live well, only that we can make the nation more greate and stable.
