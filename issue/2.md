The speaker claim that to understatnd the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities. I disagree the major cities contain mostimportant culture of a country, and we should only study major city. However, in my view, in some small country, if you only study major city, that is fine. the reason why we should study not only the major cities but also the small cities is there are lots of different situation in different areas. some Asia country like China is the best example.


if you want to study the economic of china, you should not only study major city like Beijing, Shanghai, you should also study some small city in this country. for example, Beijing and Shanghai is the most rich city in China, but it does not mean the average rich level are all like Beijing Shanghai, if you go to some small village in Western China, you will find a lots of people even can afford children to go to school, the whole family income is even one tenth of one people's income in big city like Beijing, so if youonly look the economic in Beijing and Shagnhai, China is already a deveploed country, but as long as you look at those poor village, China is still a developing country.


Also for some culture of china, like food culture, if you only study major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, you will lose the chance to explore so many decilous food. You maybe have eaten lots of chinese food in Beijing and Shanghai, but there also many other decilous food in other cities, some province like Sichuan, if you never go to that province, you will never get the truly food of "Chuan Cai"-- a famous series chinese food -- and "Chuan Cai" culture. Beijing also have some "Chuan Cai" restruant, but the taste is different. also each of province in china have different food and food culture, some of core culture you never can be found in other province, so if you want to know the food culture of this country, you can only study one or two or three major city.


However, for some small country, the whole country only have one or two cities, we can only study the major cites, beacuse that's the all, for example like Vatican City State, the whole characteristics in this country equals the whole characteristics in the city, because the whole country have only one city, for many other small country like Vatican City State, the study are same.


In Sum, the speaker's claim overstates the importance of study of major cities, and did not consider the difference of areas, at least to some extent. However, I strongly commit to the notion that we should not only consider the major city, but also consider small city in big country like China, United States etc...
